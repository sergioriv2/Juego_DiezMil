# 'Diez Mil' - A Dice Console Game

A college project and my first game created aswell, unfortunately it is only available in Spanish. Maybe a rework can be done in the future (?).

This console app recreates the gameplay of the real-life game 'Diez Mil'.


## Features

- Interactive UI
- Single and Versus mode
- Leaderboard


## What Have I Learned Developing This Game
Creating this game was hard, as I said before, this was my first ever game created in console, but I had fun and learned so much about C++ while developing it. Like how to print ASCII Art or how to create and implement  methods. In this application there is not a single class created, every functionality are just differents raws methods.
